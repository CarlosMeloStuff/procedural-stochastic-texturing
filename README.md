## Procedural Stochastic Texturing

This plugin provides an alternative Standard shader that implements our procedural stochastic texturing method. For a certain class of textures called stochastic textures, it solves the issue of tiling repetition when tileable textures are repeated across a surface. This allows using smaller textures, achieving higher levels of detail and texturing larger surfaces without the need to hide the repetition patterns.

This work is the implementation of two recent research publications at Unity Labs, which are the best resource for understanding the technique in detail.
